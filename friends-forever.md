The mouse and the frog were good friends, but after a while the frog became angry because the mouse never visited his house.\

One day, the frog snuck around and tied a piece of string to the mouse's tail and to his own leg.\

When he left the mouse's house, he dragged the mouse along with him.\

The frog jumped into the pond despite the mouse's cries that he couldn't swim, and the mouse soon drowned.\

The bitter frog thought he had taught the mouse a lesson, but soon a hawk spotted the mouse from the sky and decided to pick him up for his dinner.\

The frog then saw the error of his ways.\
